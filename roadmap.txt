DESCRIPTION
       pause() causes the calling process (or thread) to sleep until a signal is delivered that either terminates the
       process or causes the invocation of a signal-catching function.

RETURN VALUE
       pause() returns only when a signal was caught and  the  signal-catching  function  returned.   In  this  case,
       pause() returns -1, and errno is set to EINTR.

ERRORS
       EINTR  a signal was caught and the signal-catching function returned.





- Make sure to save errno at the start of sigaction handlers and restore it once they're over
- Remember to remove gnl from the lib (forbidden use of read)
